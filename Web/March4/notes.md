# Notes on March 4

html define content and structure

css define format: color, font, alignment


* in css, id is to specify unique element, use class instead to refer many elements
* seperate the style from the content, which is to say, put all styling in ccs. keep all formatting instructions in one place

* refer to ***"centre.html"*** to see how to solve the image rendering problem
