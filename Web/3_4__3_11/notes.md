# Notes on March 4 - 11

## March 4
`html` define content and structure

`css` define format: color, font, alignment


* in css, **id** is to specify unique element, use **class** instead to refer many elements

* seperate the style from the content, which is to say, put all styling in ccs. keep all formatting instructions in one place

* refer to ***"centre.html"*** to see how to solve the image rendering problem


## March 5 (Layout)

position of elements
* table (refer to thr `layout1.html` for clear sample)
* flexbox (html5 only) (refer to `layout2.html` for sample)
* float, etc
