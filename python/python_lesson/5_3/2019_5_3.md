## Stack

First In Last Out (FILO)

## Queue

First In First Out (FIFO)

```markdown
in quick implementation:
use list for stack & queue

stack:
- append
- pop

queue:
- insert(0, OBJECT)
- pop
```

- Array-based: fixed memory, fixed size, (fixed data types, not necessary in this case)
- Pointer-based: dynamic memory space, however more information to store
