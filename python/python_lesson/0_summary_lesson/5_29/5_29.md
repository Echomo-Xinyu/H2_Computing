# Class notes for May 29

`This lesson is to go through the mistakes and clarify misconcepts in the lecture test`

## Python syntax

`0, '', [], None` is implicitly evaluated to `False` in python

```python
# stops at 'or' (as the first parameter) is evaluated to be True
>>> result = 1 or True
1
# thus is important to make sure all arguments are boolean values
# 'and' takes the second argument
>>> result = "False" and "True"
'True'
>>> result = print("Hello World")
None
# `/` will always give a float and `//` will give an integer
>>> result = 4/(True == 1)
4.0
```

## List Manipulation

* There are two types of list copy:
  * `shallow copy`: reference the original list `list2 = list1`. Thus Any change in list1 will lead to change in list2
  * `deep copy`: copy the content and assign to a new list `list2 = list1[:]`

```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
# function returns None and only operates on the list
new_list = list1.append([4])
# >>> list1
# [1, 2, 3, [4]]
# >>> new_list
# None
new_list = list1 + [5]
# in list concatenation, both arguments need to be list
# >>> list1
# [1, 2, 3, [4]]
# >>> new_list
# [1, 2, 3, [4], 5]
list2 = list1[:]
# deep copy as discussed above
>>> list1 == list2
True
>>> list1 is list2
False # for deep copy, not referencing the same object
```

* slice operation

```python
>>> array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> print(array[2:-1:-1])
# 2: index two element; -1: last indexed element; -1: iterate forward instead of backwards
# thus it will never reach and thus return a None instead
>>> "a" * 3
# equivalent to "a" + "a" + "a"
"aaa"
>>> array = [[0] * 3] * 2
[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
>>> array[0][0] = 1
>>> array
[[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0]]
# first * operation is a deep copy as it is an immutable type and second * operation is a shadow copy and thus will change according to the first list
# primitive data types are all immutable and thus will not be changed; while in list, it is a mutable data type and thus can be changed
```

## Debug

* `python interpreter` will only detect the `syntax error`. All other problems will be spotted when the python file is an executable file and being executed
* The name for writing programs that fail to achieve desired outcome is `Logical Error`
* When discussing `test cases`, you are suggested to draw a table of category, test cases, purposes, expected outputes as below:

| Category | Test Case   | Purpose                      | Expected Output |
|----------|-------------|------------------------------|-----------------|
| Normal   | factors(6)  | Any Positive integer         | 4               |
| Normal   | factors(7)  | Any Positive integer         | 2               |
| Abnormal | factors(-2) | Negative values not accepted | 0               |
| Abnormal | factors(-9) | Negative values not accepted | 0               |
| Boundary | factors(1)  | Accepted                     | 1               |
| Boundary | factors(0)  | Invalid                      | 0               |

* usually we don't have exception handling inside a function

## Recursive and Iteration

* use a hierachy tree to perform a trace for recursive function
* Iterative version for recursive function is usually related with dynamic programming

## File I/O

* `with open("data.txt", "r") as file_handle:` block can handle the file as list without the step of `file_handle = open() ... file_handle.close()`
* `\` escape character to print certain characters. Or alternatively put a `r` before the string to indicate it is a special string and only output its original form

```python
>>> r"\t\n"
'\\t\\n'
```
