# 4.3 class notes

## OOP (Object Oriented programming)

### Class

### Instances & Initialization

### Attributes (vairable) & Methods (function)

* Integer: one type of object

`type(5)`

`<class 'int'>`

Instead of using predescirbed class in python, we can create our own class.

```python
class Square:
    # @__init__ function is called whenever the object is called
    # first parameter is always 'self' and link to the instance
    def __init__(self, lengthx):
        self.length = lengthx
    def findArea(self):
        return self.length ** 2

# constructor: new
x = Square(10)
print(x.length)
print(x.findArea())
```

```python
# () is for inheritance, cover later
class Rectangle():
    def __init__(self, lengthx, breadthx):
        # sometimes people write code like below:
        # self._length = lengthx
        # which suggests the varibale is private and shouldn't be accessed by outside users
        self.length = lengthx
        self.breadth = breadthx
        if type(lengthx) != type(1) or type(breadthx) != type(1.0):
            raise TypeError("Hello, please wake up.")
    def findArea(self):
        return self.length * self.breadth

x = Rectangle(10, 20)
print(x.length)
print(x.findArea())
```

```python
class Square():
    def __init__(self, length):
        self._length = length
    def findArea(self):
        return self._length ** 2
# @Rectangle class will inherit from Square class and try to use all the codes
# from the Square class
class Rectangle(Square):
    def __init__(self, length, breadth):
        # super() refers to the parent classs
        super().__init__(length)
        self._breadth = breadth
# during inheritance, if the method is not redefined (overridden), the function
# can still be called and function as the parent class
```

multiple sequence of inheritance:
`class d(a, b, c) # something to explore on`

## Why OOP

* Data Encapusaltion
* Data hiding, private / public in other progamming language
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism (Better code reuse)

```python
class etc():
    def __init__(self, string):
        self.string = string
    # define behaviour of str()
    def __str__(self):
        return "This is: " + str(string)
    def __eq__(self, other):
        # define the behaviour of ==
        return True
```
