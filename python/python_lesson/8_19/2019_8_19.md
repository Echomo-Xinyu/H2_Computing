# Database

operations in a database: **C**(select) **R**(read) **U**(update) **D**(delete)

**Database**: an *organized collection* of data in **persistent** storage.

Flat files:

- Anomalies during insert, delete, update and query

Due to anomalies, we need relational data model.

- ERD: entities, relationships, cardinality
- Normalisation -> relations(tables), attributes, primary/foreign keys
  - reasons for normalisation:
    - reduce redundancy
    - maintain consistency
    - avoid anomalies

- To clarify terms:
  - table: entity, relation
  - rows: records, tuple
  - attributes: columns, fields
  - relationships: linkage between tables and cardinality represents the 0/1/n relationships

**Database applictaion**: a program for entering and retrieving information from a database

Feature sof a Database Management System:

- persistnet data
- security
- concurrent access
- integrity
- data definitrion language
- data manipulation language
- data dictionary
  - meta-data:
    - the description of tables, relationshjips and all design information such as indexing
    - indexes are data structures created for fast retrieval -- possibly BST
    - the rules about data integrity including validation rules for all attributes
    - enforces rules known as database constraints to ensure the accuracy and ocnsistency of the data
      - Example: NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK `CHECK(LENGTH(Name) < 20)`

SQL is generally universal and standardised.

- primary key
- foreign key --  cannot be set NULL
- Secondary key can serve as primary key if primary key not present.
- Composite key means that there are more than one key serveing as the primary key

**referntial integrity**:

- cannot insett a record in student table until referenced teacger record is created
- cannot delete/update a teacher record until all the records in student table that references it are deleted
