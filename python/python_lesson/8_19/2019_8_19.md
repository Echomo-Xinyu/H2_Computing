# Database

operations in a database: **C**(select) **R**(read) **U**(update) **D**(delete)

**Database**: an *organized collection* of data in **persistent** storage.

Flat files:

- Anomalies during insert, delete, update and query

Due to anomalies, we need relational data model.

- ERD: entities, relationships, cardinality
- Normalisation -> relations(tables), attributes, primary/foreign keys
  - reasons for normalisation:
    - reduce redundancy
    - maintain consistency
    - avoid anomalies

- To clarify terms:
  - table: entity, relation
  - rows: records, tuple
  - attributes: columns, fields
  - relationships: linkage between tables and cardinality represents the 0/1/n relationships

**Database applictaion**: a program for entering and retrieving information from a database

Feature sof a Database Management System:

- persistnet data
- security
- concurrent access
- integrity
- data definitrion language
- data manipulation language
- data dictionary
  - meta-data:
    - the description of tables, relationshjips and all design information such as indexing
    - indexes are data structures created for fast retrieval -- possibly BST
    - the rules about data integrity including validation rules for all attributes
    - enforces rules known as database constraints to ensure the accuracy and ocnsistency of the data
      - Example: NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK `CHECK(LENGTH(Name) < 20)`

SQL is generally universal and standardised.

- primary key
- foreign key --  cannot be set NULL
- Secondary key can serve as primary key if primary key not present.
- Composite key means that there are more than one key serveing as the primary key

**referntial integrity**:

- cannot insett a record in student table until referenced teacger record is created
- cannot delete/update a teacher record until all the records in student table that references it are deleted

**concurrent access**:

- Allow the 2nd uypdate request to take place **only** after the 1st update request regarding the same record has been completed
  - Thats also why `connection.commit()` esssential
- The sequence only restricted in the **record** level -- operations on different records are allowed at the same time

**Data security**:

- Access Control
  - who can acess what -- `dwr`
- Back up
  - Full (weekly)
  - Differential, backup only changes since last full (daily)
  - purpose: for recovery when data is lost or corrupted
- Archive
  - Purpose: for space management and long term retention. Original may be deleted.

SQL: structured query language

- Data Definition Language `CREATE, DROP`
- Data Manipukation Language `SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE`
- Database Control Language
- Transaction Control Languag2e

Type Affinities in SQLite

- support the concept of type affinity on columns
- type affinity refers to the preferred type for data stored in a column
  - "Preferred Type" means the default type of data in a record -- only in SQLite
  - `INTEGER, TEXT, REAL, NUMERIC, BLOB`: `BLOB`: binary large object, `NUMERIC` includes both `INTEGER` and `REAL`
