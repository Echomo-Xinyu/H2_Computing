# Data Persistence

Why:

- Store the data in a more persistent manner

How:

- As binary on text files
    1. serial - chonological order - log files
    2. sequential - key value order - student files based on NRIC
    3. random access - hash value order -  bank accounts

- fixed-width values/records
