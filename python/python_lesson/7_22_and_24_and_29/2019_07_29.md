Flat File (DB) -> Normalisation -> relational DB

* Update & Select: duplicate values
* Insert & delete: nested record

Due to two types of anomalies, the DB should be normalized

Short-Cut normalisation (Entities / relations)

1. Identify the entities ~ look for columns (attributes) that can encapsulated in a class -> determine the attributes to go into seperate files
2. Draw ER-Diagram: Entity-relationship diagram (ERD)
    * Entities
    * relationships -> with possible min and max cardinalities
        * `◯`: zero; `-`: one; `∧`: many
        * `[A] ----<|-- [B]`: Each A has min 1 and max many instances of B
        * `[A] ----||-- [B]`: each a has min1 and max 1 instance of B
3. Identify All many-to-many relationsjips
    * `[A] ->----<- [B]`: for each such relationship, insert an intermediateentity to remove the many-to-mant relationship
    * `[A] |---<- [A*B] ->--|-[B]`: each instance of 'A*B' has one 'B' and one 'A'
