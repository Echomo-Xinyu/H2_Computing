# 3.29 class notes

## Test cases

* normal: .. (refer to the literal meaning...

* boundary: extreme case for normal data
  * for example: 0 for Z+

* abnormal: wrong or wrongly formatted data
  * for example: -1 for Z+

## Recursion & Iteration

* tail-end recursion (another is called tree recursion)
* wrap-up function

## File I/O

```python
# first parameter: pathway towards the file
# second parameter: "r" for read mode, "w" for write mode, "a" for append
file_handler = open("FILENAME.TXT", "w")

'''
# process the whole file as a big string
# the string can have multiple lines
# or alternatively with '\n' to indicate the end of line (last line included)
rdata = file_handler.read()
# assume the content is "1, 98, 99, 50, \"max\"\n2, 50, 60, 70, \"sam\"\n"
for line in range(len(rdata)):
    rdata[i] = rdata[i].split(',')
'''
data = []
for line in file_handler:
    data.append(line.split(','))

file_handler.close()
```

* write content into the file

```python
# 'w' assumes creating a new file and will overwrite everything inside the file before
file_handler = open("FILENAME.TXT", "w")
file_handler.write("Hello!!!!")

for i in range(len(data)):
    line = ",".join(data[i])
    file_handler.write(line + '\n')

file_handler.close()
```

```python
# "a" for append and will create a new file if not exist
# also it will continue from the log before

```
