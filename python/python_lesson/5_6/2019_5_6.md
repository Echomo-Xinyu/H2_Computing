# 2019.5.6 class notes

```rua
It's said that this class has covered the binary search tree, but anyway I was absent. So yay, just refers to the bst.py code
```

* The first crafted version `bst.py` is able for most functions, except the delete operation.
* In order to address the problem, one new attribute `tombstone` is used to indicate whether the node has been deleted or not. Refer to the `bst_ex.py` for details. Yet the file may not be complete as I'm lazy.
