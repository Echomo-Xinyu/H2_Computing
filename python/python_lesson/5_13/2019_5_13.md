## Overview of data structures

`the first part overall review of data structures learned (Linked List, Stack, Queue, Binary Search Tree), to be frank, not much to learn. Thus no notes taken.`

|--------------------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Linked List (LL)         | O(1)   | O(n)   | O(n)   |
| Stack                    | O(1)   | O(1)   | NA     |
| Queue                    | O(1)   | O(1)   | NA     |
| Binary Search Tree (BST) | O(n)   | O(n)   | O(n)   |

## Hash

`O(1)` complexity, achieved by RAM (random-access machine, ie array)

Use a hash function f(Â·) such that f(obj) -> integer value, used as the index of the array
